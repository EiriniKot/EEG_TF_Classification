# EEG Classification
The EEG signal is measured by placing multiple electrodes on the scalp that
measure the current flow from neurons. It is generally more convenient for researchers
than fMRI. This experiment tries to capture neuron activity while they think of an imaginary motion.
The categories of thinking are: left, right, both, none.

# Preprocessing
In order to find the points of interest in the signals we applied STFT and Wavelet analysis.
